# Rails Application

This is a newly generated Rails application using
[RH Productions' Quickstart](https://github.com/ryan-hunter-pc/quickstart)

**You'll want to edit this README to document the specific application this will become.**

# Development Environment

To setup a new development environment:

1. Clone the codebase
2. Run the setup script: `bin/setup`
3. Run the development environment: `foreman start -f Procfile.dev`
3. (Optional) Run a TDD environment in a separate terminal: `bundle exec guard`
